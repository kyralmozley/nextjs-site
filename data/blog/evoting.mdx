### Abstract:
> This paper will discuss the issues countries face beyond the technical challenge of implementing a secure electronic voting system. We start by exploring the history of national elections, the systemâ€™s current flaws, and why moving to electronic-based voting would be beneficial. We look at the requirements for an e-voting system; we discuss the challenges nations face in developing trust, acceptance, and creating a system with usability in mind, allowing voters to feel secure in adopting this new technology. Lastly, we turn to look at the implementation of e-voting in Estonia and discuss whether it could be done as successfully in the UK.


This project was interesting as it took me out of my comfort zone, embodying the interdisciplinary approach of the CDT by focusing not on how e-voting systems may be cryptographically secure but by how it affects the security of the human using them.
