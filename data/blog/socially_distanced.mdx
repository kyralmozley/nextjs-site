## Get real time estimates on how busy locations are
As the country begins to re-open we must maintain social distancing to prevent further spread of COVID-19. That's why we built socially distanced. 

We provide real-time predictions as to whether or not socially distancing is currently viable for location, as well as queue estimates for stores. We also provided a daily forecast by the hour for our predictions, allowing you to pick the perfect time to visit a location.

### Technical Details
The application is built in Java and is currently awaiting approval from the Google play store and will be available on devices running KitKat and above. This is the app version of sociallydistanced.space. Using a combination of custom-generated datasets and user feedback, we use AI to be able to make a prediction about a given location.
