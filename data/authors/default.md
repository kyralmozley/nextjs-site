My past research has focused on AI / Machine Learning / Computer Vision, and their uses for Cyber Security. I am currently focusing on creating methods to detect DeepFake videos to make the web safer. 

I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2020 with a First Class BA (Hons) in Computer Science. For my undergraduate dissertation, I researched Machine Learning methods to detect Network Attacks. I investigated both supervised and unsupervised models on the CICIDS2017 dataset. I then selected the best performing model (Random Forest) to implement into my own Intrusion Detection System built using Python. I then performed final testing by simulating network attacks myself using tools available in Kali Linux. The detection occurred in real-time and also included several attacks that had not been seen in the training phase to test the model's generalisation. 
 
I am now in my second year of Royal Holloways CDT in Cyber Security, and will be pausing my research to do an internship as a Machine Learning Engineer at Wayve, who are building the next generation of autonomous vehicles.
